- <b>Description:</b> I created a Python program using dictionaries to test a theory in the video game "League of Legends" whether players who are randomly generated to the 'blue' side team have an advantage over the players who are randomly generated to the 'red' side team. This was done using data gathered from professional as well as recreational players.
